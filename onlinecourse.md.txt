## Do I work through Global Campus or can I just build this in Angel?

If you wish to teach a 100% online course, you need to work through [Global Campus](http://teach.wsu.edu/OnlineCourses/). The process you need to follow is outlined [here](http://teach.wsu.edu/OnlineCourses/develop/process.aspx). 

If you have a required meeting on campus for your course, no matter what its length, you can choose to offer your course as a local online course. Examples of required meeting include any meeting where attendance is taken or a grade is given -- a proctored exam, a study session, a required office hours visit.

## Blended Courses

While the college calls courses that replace more than 75% of meetings with online equivalents *hybrid*, we consider any class that combines web-based components with face-to-face contact to be *blended instruction*, regardless of the percentages

If you would like local campus support for your blended course, contact [Michael Caulfield](mailto:michael.caulfield@vancouver.wsu.edu).
