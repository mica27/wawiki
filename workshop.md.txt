### How to Set up a Class Website or Blog and Why You Might Want To
Face-to-face: Thursday, September 19, noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, September 20, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

Sometimes your Learning Management System (a.k.a LMS, whether it is Angel or Blackboard or something else) is a perfectly fine space for your class to do their work. But when you want your class to engage with the outside world, the LMS can become profoundly limiting. This session will show you how to set up a class website or blog for $12, and show how other classes have used class websites to foster student engagement with both the class and outside community, and make student projects more meaningful.

### Using Social Media to Connect Classes Together: The Waterfeed Example
Face-to-face: Thursday, September 26, noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, September 27, 2 p.m. 

One of the experiments we are running next semester (SP14) is Waterfeed, a lightweight way to connect multiple classes together via social media. The idea is simple – use water issues, even for a week or two, as a way to explain issues in your course, and have the students interact with a cross-institutional Waterfeed community via blogging, social bookmarking, commenting, or just reading the latest news. Because this project allows “differential participation” (your class can participate for as little as a day or as much as a semester) this is a perfect project for social media newbies. More information about the project here: . Come having viewed the 10 minute introduction at that link, and ready to talk about it.

### Reducing Student Textbook Cost Through the Use of Open Educational Resources
Face-to-face: Thursday, October 3, 12 noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, October 4, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

Open Educational Resources (free digital educational resources, like open textbooks, videos, etc) have come a long way in the past decade. It is increasingly possible to teach many introductory courses using these resources instead of a traditional textbook. This session will introduce you to a project we are running at Washington State Vancouver to help faculty who would like to go textbook-free to do that. We especially encourage faculty teaching introductory courses to attend, as these courses tend to benefit the most from these resources. 

We will send out a new announcement with additional workshops first week of October. Please let us know if you would like to facilitate or co-facilitate a workshop.
