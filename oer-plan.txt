## The Kaleidoscope Project (use of Open Materials) 

We have partnered with [Lumen Learning](http://www.lumenlearning.com/) to bring high-quality open digital materials to campus along with support for faculty who use them. Our plan is to have faculty use these materials in Spring of 2014, and evaluate their effectiveness as part of a larger research project. 

### Materials available

The materials currently available are:

* Introduction to Psychology
* Introduction to Business
* Introduction to Biology
* College Algebra
* English Composition I
* College Success
* Developmental Reading
* Developmental Writing

### Process 

Anyone who wants to participate should contact me (michael.caulfield@vancouver.wsu.edu) and we will talk through the opportunity. There is an as-yet-undetermined stipend that will support your work in this area.
