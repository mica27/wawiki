## Workshop Materials: Fall 2013


### Using Google Hangouts and Hangouts on Air to Open Up Your Classroom
Face-to-face: Thursday, September 12, noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, September 13, 2 p.m. 

Do you occasionally want to run a study session from your home? Broadcast a presentation to a worldwide audience live? Interview experts from around the world and record those interviews for your students? This session will introduce you to Hangouts and Hangouts On Air, and talk about how educators are using these tools to make their courses more flexible, engaging, and effective.

### How to Set up a Class Website or Blog and Why You Might Want To
Face-to-face: Thursday, September 19, noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, September 20, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

Sometimes your Learning Management System (a.k.a LMS, whether it is Angel or Blackboard or something else) is a perfectly fine space for your class to do their work. But when you want your class to engage with the outside world, the LMS can become profoundly limiting. This session will show you how to set up a class website or blog for $12, and show how other classes have used class websites to foster student engagement with both the class and outside community, and make student projects more meaningful.

### Using Social Media to Connect Classes Together: The Waterfeed Example
Face-to-face: Thursday, September 26, noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, September 27, 2 p.m. 

One of the experiments we are running next semester (SP14) is Waterfeed, a lightweight way to connect multiple classes together via social media. The idea is simple – use water issues, even for a week or two, as a way to explain issues in your course, and have the students interact with a cross-institutional Waterfeed community via blogging, social bookmarking, commenting, or just reading the latest news. Because this project allows “differential participation” (your class can participate for as little as a day or as much as a semester) this is a perfect project for social media newbies. More information about the project here: . Come having viewed the 10 minute introduction at that link, and ready to talk about it.

### Reducing Student Textbook Cost Through the Use of Open Educational Resources
Face-to-face: Thursday, October 3, 12 noon. VCES 104
Google Hangout: Friday, October 4, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

Open Educational Resources (free digital educational resources, like open textbooks, videos, etc) have come a long way in the past decade. It is increasingly possible to teach many introductory courses using these resources instead of a traditional textbook. This session will introduce you to a project we are running at Washington State Vancouver to help faculty who would like to go textbook-free to do that. We especially encourage faculty teaching introductory courses to attend, as these courses tend to benefit the most from these resources. 

We will send out a new announcement with additional workshops first week of October. Please let us know if you would like to facilitate or co-facilitate a workshop.

### Social Bookmarking for Understanding 
Face-to-face: Thursday, October 17, noon. VECS 120
Google Hangout: Friday, October 18, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

We’ll demonstrate how you can use social bookmarking tools in your classroom both to help your students stay organized and to promote critical thinking about online texts. This session offers a solution as well for students who complain that they have to “remember” too many websites – this is a tool that can help them organize those links.

### Wikis for Student Collaboration
Face-to-face: Thursday, October 24, noon. VECS 120
Google Hangout: Friday, October 25, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

Most students know wikis primarily through Wikipedia, but the roots of wikis lie in knowledge management. Wikis can provide a way for your students to produce, organize, and refine knowledge about a subject in the collaborative fashion that many professional and academic tasks today require. This session will show you what a wiki is, how to set one up, and examples of what students can do in this framework.

### Using a Course Hub to Aggregate Student Social Media
Face-to-face: Thursday, October 31, noon. VLIB 210
Google Hangout: Friday, November 1, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

One of the things we discovered in our Course Website presentation two weeks ago was that a number of instructors are having students blog and use other social media, but are overwhelmed with the management of the process. We’ll spend fifteen minutes showing how course hubs may be able to help you bring together all your students social media streams into one place that can serve as a focal point for students and a class management aid for you.

### Fair Use in the Online Classroom (Facilitated by Linda Frederiksen)
Face-to-face: Thursday, November 7, noon. VLIB 160B
Google Hangout: Friday, November 8, 2 p.m. (Instructions below).

Law and licenses create a complicated environment for faculty who wish to post copyrighted material or stream video online to their courses through learning management systems.  This librarian-led session will provide a brief overview of your fair use rights, responsibilities, options and opportunities in a networked environment.  It will also help you determine strategies for identifying what kinds of materials you can use to support teaching in your hybrid or online classes. Please note session location of this session, one of the library conference rooms, VLIB 160B.
