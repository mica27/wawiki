## Building a Course Hub

### What is a Course Hub?

As professors move towards teaching "in the open" they may find they need a site that brings together the multiple resources and communications produced by a course. Such resources might include documents, blog posts, twitter feeds, wikis, social bookmarks as well as more traditional communications. 

### Why would I put a Course Hub on the open web? Whats wrong with putting it all in Angel/Blackboard/Canvas?

Every class is different, and there are a variety of reasons people use open website to pull these streams together. 

  * Authenticity
  * Transparency
  * Ease of Access
  * Impact
  * Integration issues

### How do I get started?

We have the resources to help you. 


### Can you show me some examples? 

#### Simple Hub

Clare Wilkinson-Weber's Arts and Media class sports a [good example](http://anth301-fa13.com/) of a simple hub.

In [this hub](http://anth301-fa13.com/) links to classroom resources are shown in the menubar, while the mainpage serves as a prompt for students to react to questions the instructor asks and examples the instructor finds. Some pages are password protected so that the students can interact privately. 


#### Syndication Hub

[This hub](http://blendedandnetworked.com/va/) is a little more complex.
