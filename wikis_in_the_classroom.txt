=====Wikis in the Classroom=====

Wikis -- student editable web-based reference works -- are a great fit for many courses. When using a wiki in a class, students usually commit to write a number of articles meant for public consumption. 

We encourage students to write on wikis that can be edited by and commented on by people outside their class, as such commentary both helps students to produce better work and allows the work to be maintained and updated after students leave. At the same time, early on students may wish to shield early work from too much interference. To try and balance these two goals, we've put together the [[http://ref.topichub.us | Topic Hub]] a space where we allow WSU students and select outsiders to create and publish work. 

For more information on using Wikis in the classroom, you can:

  * Look at our [[wikiclassroom | workshop resources page]] on wikis
  * Attend a workshop
  * Stop by VDEN 207 and we'll talk about how we could use these in your classroom
