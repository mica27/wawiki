### Wiki for student collaboration

Clare is using a MediaWiki installation to help students collaborate on a task that requires extensive discussion about cultural artifacts. We're hoping that the set up of the "talk" page on the wiki will be a more profitable place for that conversation than an Angel forum. 

### Course Hub as a way to increase student engagement

For Fall 2013, Clare is using a WordPress website as a tool to communicate with the class and disseminate assignments. This method, which we are referring to as building a "Course Hub", creates a different feel to the posts and conversations than they would have in Angel.
